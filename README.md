### Background
- Water scarcity is becoming a problem in our society as global warming worsens & water usage increase. To tackle this problem, we wanted to emphasize improving how homeowners water their lawns because 30% of household water usage is outdoor water and 50% of this water used is wasted.

### Goals
- Affordability to Consumer
- Measure Moisture
- Water Plants
- Wireless Capability
- Leak Detection
- Digital User Control

### Approach
- Capacitive Moisture Sensor
- Raspberry Pi
- Ultrasonic Transducers
- TI Ultrasonic Sensing Evaluation Module
- Solenoid Water Valves

### Tech Stack
